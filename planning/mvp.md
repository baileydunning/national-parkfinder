# National Parkfinder MVP Proposal

## Product

On load a random national park will be called through the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm).  On the side panel, all park names are visible in a dropdown list so they can be visited in an identical view. Users can search for them by full or partial name/state. Within the park view, the user can see park details, a map, and contact information about that park. The user also has the ability to "favorite" and add that park to their "bucket list".

The wireframe can be found [here](https://github.com/jaypeasee/national-parkfinder/blob/main/planning/wireframe-v1.png).

There will be a separate profile view where the user can see their complete list of favorite parks and bucket list and can remove or check them off. This information will be stored using localStorage.

## Technologies:
